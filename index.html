        <p><b>Executive Summary:</b> Over the past few years, artificial intelligence such as facial recognition and its implications are on the rise. <a href="https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/">Computer Scientist, Joy Buolamwini</a> believes that the underrepresentation of women and people of color in the technology sector has led to technology that only serves a subsection of the United States population.<p> 
        In 2010, NIST published a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/other-race-effect-face-recognition-algorithms-0">study</a> that found that Caucasian faces were more accurately recognized when software was developed by White engineers and Asian faces were more accurately recognized in the software that was created by East Asian engineers. This re-emphasizes what we all know too well: our inherent biases can cloud even the most professional minds and that representation matters!</p>
        
        <p><b> Policy Recommendation: </b>I recommend that policy makers and local school districts do their part that can impact a field that develops products that disproportionately affects people of color. Let's start from scratch and demand more attention be paid to the exposure that high school students have to computer science education and industry professionals that looks like them in the hopes that it will lead to a more equitable and responsible future of AI.</p>
