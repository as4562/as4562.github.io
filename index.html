        <p><b>Executive Summary:</b> Over the past few years, artificial intelligence such as facial recognition and its implications are on the rise. <a href="https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/">Computer Scientist, Joy Buolamwini</a> believes that the underrepresentation of women and people of color in the technology sector has led to technology that only serves a subsection of the United States population.<p> 
        In 2010, NIST published a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/other-race-effect-face-recognition-algorithms-0">study</a> that found that Caucasian faces were more accurately recognized when software was developed by White engineers and Asian faces were more accurately recognized in the software that was created by East Asian engineers. This re-emphasizes what we all know too well: our inherent biases can cloud even the most professional minds and that representation matters!</p>
        
        <p><b>Current Context:</b> Many students do not have access to computer science learning opportunities at school, with lower-income students and Black students having the least access. Moreover, many of the schools that do offer computer science do not have it is a part of their coursework. The rapid advancement in technology and the growing number of professions and industries that rely on computer science are a major reason for all students to have access to opportunities to become computer literate and to gain foundational computer science skills. Not having an early foundation of computer science built in K-12 education, students may not be encouraged to take up these courses in higher education and eventually leading to in-demand technology jobs. Not having early access to computer science can eventually lead to an industry leading the way on technological advancements yet falling behind on diversifying the field of engineers and scientists behind the technology. Numerous studies have been done to show that gender and skin-type bias exist in commercial artificial intelligence systems. <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/what-do-we-do-about-the-biases-in-ai">Harvard Business Review</a> and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-bias-in-artificial-intelligence-and-in-humans">McKinsey</a> have published essential steps for management to lead the way on bias and fairness; notably, to invest more in diversifying the AI field itself. A more diverse community would be better able to anticipate, review, and spot bias. To this extent, companies such as Amazon are investing in programs to bring computer science courses to underprivileged and low-income high schools.</p>
        
        <p><b> Policy Recommendation: </b>I recommend that policy makers and local school districts do their part that can impact a field that develops products that disproportionately affects people of color. Let's start from scratch and demand more attention be paid to the exposure that high school students have to computer science education and industry professionals that looks like them in the hopes that it will lead to a more equitable and responsible future of AI.</p>
        
        <p>While companies such as <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals">Microsoft</a> are taking the initiative to bring computer science courses to underprivileged and low-income high schools, it is equally as important to ask the same of our elected officials, policy makers, and school districts. </p>
